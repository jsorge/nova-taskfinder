## Version 1.7

* The icon for each task now reflects the running state.
* The package is re-listed under the Tasks category, thanks to Panic changing their validation criteria.

Note: The whole tree is refreshed for now, as asking the element to reload isn't working.

## Version 1.6

* Implemented the "Show in Finder" feature, for a given task. Thanks go to [ReÃ¼el van der Steege](https://github.com/rvdsteege).
* Removed the "Tasks" category, as it requires pre-determined tasks to be provided. This extension determines them automatically.

## Version 1.4

* Sidebar image fixed

## Version 1.3

* Several bugs fixed.
* Configuration added (see Readme).
* Made into Treeware.

## Version 1.0

Initial release based on how Nova Version 1.0b7 (145647) works.

I can't work out how to make custom images work for sidebars yet ðŸ¤¯ - it'll get an icon once I've figured that out.
