Automatically runs through and finds all package.json files from the workspace directory and, based on a config setting, will then recursively search into other folders.

## Features

- Per-workspace setting to allow
  - Specific directories to be ignored
  - Choice between NPM/Yarn for task execution
  - To choose whether to recursively search for package.json
- Reveal the file in which the task was found in Finder

## To Do

These can now be seen (and added to) in the [issues log](https://github.com/little-green-man/nova-taskfinder/issues).

Note: Panic have indicated that they are working on API integration with the native Build/Run Tasks in a future major version.
Once established, Task Finder will take advantage of it. For now, running tasks are identified through notifications and a changed TreeItem icon.
Output can be seen in the Extension Console.

Pull requests are welcome.
