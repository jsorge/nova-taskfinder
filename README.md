![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/little-green-man/nova-taskfinder/master/Images/docs/screenshot.png)

## Features

- _Nova Tasks_ automatically populated from top-level `package.json` and `composer.json` files
- Per-workspace setting to choose NPM/Yarn for task execution

## Usage

- Install and activate the extension
- Check the global settings for your package manager and their path(s)
- Check the project settings for which package manager to use
  - Project settings will override global ones, if you wish to customise package manager paths on a per-project basis.

The rest is pretty much automatic. Tasks will refresh on appropriate file or settings changes.
